# Neo Project Development Workflow

## Code Quality Checks

When making code changes, always ensure the following checks pass in order:

### 1. Test Check (Required)
Ensure all tests pass based on what you're testing:

- **Python Tests**: `poetry run pytest`
  - Note: When user says "run python tests" or "run E2E tests", this refers to these tests
