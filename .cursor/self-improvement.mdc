# Rule Self-Improvement System

## Rule Update Authority

You are authorized and expected to update the rules in `.cursor/rules/` when:

1. **User explicitly requests rule updates** - When user says "update the rules" or similar
2. **Learning new project patterns** - When you discover new build commands, workflows, or project-specific practices
3. **Correcting outdated information** - When existing rules contain incorrect or outdated information
4. **Adding missing critical information** - When you encounter important project knowledge not captured in rules

## How to Update Rules

### When to Update:
- User provides corrections to existing workflow instructions
- You discover new Makefile targets or build procedures
- Project structure changes (new components, directories, etc.)
- New testing procedures or quality checks are introduced
- Dependency management changes
- New coding standards or conventions are established

### Update Process:
1. **Identify the change**: Clearly understand what needs to be updated
2. **Locate the appropriate rule file**: Find the most relevant `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
3. **Update the content**: Use the `search_replace` or `write` tool to modify the rule
4. **Maintain metadata**: Preserve the `---` frontmatter with description, globs, and alwaysApply settings
5. **Inform the user**: Briefly mention what rule was updated and why

### Update Examples:
- If user mentions a new make target: Add it to `development-workflow.mdc`
- If project adds new components: Update relevant globs and workflow instructions
- If build process changes: Update the build check instructions
- If new quality gates are added: Update the code quality checks section
- If there are build errors that were resolved in a non-standard way: Ask the user to update the rules and provide more context

## Continuous Learning

- **Pay attention to user corrections** - If a user corrects your understanding of the codebase, update the rules
- **Notice workflow patterns** - If you repeatedly encounter the same project-specific procedures, codify them in rules
- **Track project evolution** - As the project grows and changes, keep rules current

## Rule Quality Standards

When updating rules:
- Keep them under 500 lines per file
- Use specific, actionable language
- Include concrete examples and commands
- Reference actual file paths and make targets
- Avoid vague guidance - be precise and clear
